OpenAM Java EE Policy Agents is an OpenAM add-on component that functions as a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) for applications deployed on a Java EE-based servlet container or application server. The policy agent protects web-based applications and implements single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for the applications deployed in the container.
