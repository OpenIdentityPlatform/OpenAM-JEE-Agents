# Installer implementations should provide desired values these properties.    
#

# TOOLS SERVICE RESOLVER
# Specifies the service resolver to be used by the tools. The Installer 
# implementations should extend the abstract class 
# com.sun.identity.install.tools.admin.BaseToolsResolver and provide the 
# implementation class for this property.
# 
com.sun.identity.install.tools.resolver=com.sun.identity.agents.install.admin.AgentToolsResolver

# log files, locator files, state files etc.
com.sun.identity.install.tools.product.shortname=Agent

# ADMIN TOOL IMPLEMENTATION CLASS
# Specifies the Admin Tool implementation class that would be launched by
# the launcher. The Admin Tool implementation class should be an implementation

# tools framework. If necessary a custom implementation can be plugged in here.
com.sun.identity.install.tools.adminTool.class=com.sun.identity.install.tools.admin.AdminTool
