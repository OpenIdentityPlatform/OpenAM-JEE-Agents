#
# AGENT USERNAME AND PASSWORD PROPERTIES
#   These are the credentials used by the Agent to identify and 
#   authenticate itself before requesting any services that require the 
#   Agent to be authenticated. If plain text password should not be 
#   used, then supply the encrypted password and encryption key.
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No
#
com.sun.identity.agents.app.username = @AGENT_PROFILE_NAME@
com.iplanet.am.service.secret = @AGENT_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD@

# The key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt passwords
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No

#
# DEBUG SERVICE PROPERTIES
#   - com.iplanet.services.debug.directory: Specifies the complete path to the
#     directory where debug files will be stored by the Agent.
#   - com.sun.services.debug.mergeall: consolidates all the debug information
#     into one file if it is set to on. Each component has its own debug file
#     if it is set to off.
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No
#
com.iplanet.services.debug.level=error

#   the Agent during runtime. The default value "/" identifies the root
#   organization or realm.

#
# LOCK OF AGENT CONFIGURATION
#    When it's set to true, agent config in run-time is locked.
#    Agent has to be restarted to let agent config change take effective 
#    whether the changed config parameter is Hot-Swap or not.
#    When it's set to false, change of Hot-Swap agent config parameter can be 
#    updated into run-time.
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No
#
com.sun.identity.agents.config.lock.enable = false

#
# AGENT PROFILE NAME
#   The profile name used by the Agent to fetch the agent configuration data.
#   The value of this property is the same as that of com.sun.identity.agents.app.username
#   in most cases. However if multiple agent instances need to use the same credentials
#   to authenticate, com.sun.identity.agents.app.username and com.iplanet.am.service.secret
#   need to be set to the authenticating credentials accordingly.
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No
#
com.sun.identity.agents.config.profilename = @AGENT_PROFILE_NAME@

#
# OPENAM DEPLOYMENT URI
#   This property controls the URI under which OpenAM has been deployed. If this
#   parameter is not supplied then the default value is /openam.
